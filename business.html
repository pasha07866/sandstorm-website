          <h3><strong>Global Audit Logging</strong></h3>
          <p>[maybe someday] Monitor data across your whole organization to keep track of who has accessed what. Not implemented yet, but Sandstorm can do this transparently, without help from the apps.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <span class="image"></span>
        <h3><strong>Automatic Encryption</strong></h3>
        <p>[maybe someday] Sandstorm's fine-grained model makes it possible for the platform to encrypt every grain with a unique key at rest, and to guarantee that the key can only be accessed by those who have been granted permission to that grain -- all completely transparent to the app. We haven't implemented this yet, but our model allows for it.</p>
